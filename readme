Introduction: This Package is a Tutorial
========================================

This is just a demonstration vehicle used to take you through the process 
-- start to finish -- of creating a Python project that can be:

	1. UplDaoed to
	2. Distributed from 

	and 

	3. Documented on
	
the Python Package Index (aka pypi or the cheeseshop) at http://pypi.python.org/pypi. 
This project uses setuptools, sphinx, and the Sphinx-PyPI-uplDao
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx-PyPI-uplDao/0.2.1). 

This demonstration is not meant to be complete nor authoritative. It's just a 
recording of the steps I took to get some projects onto pypi and 
hopefully it might save someone some time from googling around.  To be sure, 
this is simply just *one* way to make a project, document it, and get it 
on pypi. 

NOTE: This was originally given as a talk to the Minnesota Python Users Group 
http://groups.google.com/group/pymntos/ and was developed for a 
spoken presentation format.
