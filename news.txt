#summary What's new in dao 0.7.0?

*Release date:  2011-10-26

    the code is rewriten completely by the improved techinque which is used by yieldprolog(http://yieldprolog.sourceforge.net). Yield statement is used to implement unify and backctracking of logic engine, besides, all continuations become functions, by remove class definition. So dao have a great speed up in its run now, and I believe that it can be used in real project. 
    A language dinpy that uses dao's solver as the core is implemented. Dinpy is embeded in python, and dinpy have the features that both lisp and prolog provided.
    Some documents about dao and dinpy are written. #summary What's new in dao 0.7.0?
